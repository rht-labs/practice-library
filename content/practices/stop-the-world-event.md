## What is it?

A "Stop the World" event is when somebody on the Team identifies that the engagement is off-course for one reason or another. The *FULL* Team then works together to find a compromise that is acceptable to all and continues progress towards customer success. By the end of the "Stop the World" event, the team should:

- All be in agreement with the proposed compromise
- Identify actions or changes and owners
- Maintain good Psychological Safety[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) among the Team

## Why use "Stop the World" events?

- There is an aspect of the engagement that is found to be missing. A key output or outcome that supports customer success.
- A practice or an outcome needs to change based on new customer information. This change is one that would fundamentally change an output or outcome previously agreed to.
- The delivery team skillset changes for any reason that would affect customer success.
- Priority with the customer fundamentally changes the previously agreed direction of the delivery team.
- An previously agreed to input to a practice is not met or will not be met
